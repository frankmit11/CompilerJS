/*This document's purpose is to outline and describe the structure of
 my compiler and its functions. As well as describe the documentation style used 
 in my code. I entail for my compiler to be written in 
 JavaScript and as result I anticipate it to run within any type of
 web browser. Like all compilers, I intend for my compiler to efficiently
 and successfully translate high level human readable computer languages into 
 machine readable code for execution. The backbone of my compiler will rely
 heavily on the grammar and the semantics that I define which will map out how 
 the compiler handles the translation of high level coding languages. By
 developing a strong grammar that the parser can recognize and validate this 
 compiler will have a good foundation thereby contributing to its efficient ability
 to translate human readable programming languages.
